Who NOT to Follow on GitHub ❌

GitHub is for code, so avoid:

    Inactive accounts (haven't contributed in years).
    Spammers & bots (some accounts just post junk).
    Low-quality repos (projects with no documentation or purpose).
    People who don’t align with your interests (follow devs you actually want to learn from).
