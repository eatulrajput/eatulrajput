Who NOT to Follow on GitHub ❌

GitHub is for code, so avoid:

    Inactive accounts (haven't contributed in years).
    Spammers & bots (some accounts just post junk).
    Low-quality repos (projects with no documentation or purpose).
    People who don’t align with your interests (follow devs you actually want to learn from).

💡 Tip: Don't just follow people—engage with projects, star repos, and contribute! 🚀 Find your interests.


💡 How to Get the Best from LinkedIn?
    
    ✅ Follow industry leaders & experts in your field.
    ✅ Engage with high-quality posts (commenting = networking).
    ✅ Post your own insights & projects.
    ✅ Avoid spammy, low-value content.
