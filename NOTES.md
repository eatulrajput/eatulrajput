Who NOT to Follow on GitHub ❌

GitHub is for code, so avoid:

    Inactive accounts (haven't contributed in years).
    Spammers & bots (some accounts just post junk).
    Low-quality repos (projects with no documentation or purpose).
    People who don’t align with your interests (follow devs you actually want to learn from).

💡 Tip: Don't just follow people—engage with projects, star repos, and contribute! 🚀 Find your interests.


💡 How to Get the Best from LinkedIn?
    
    ✅ Follow industry leaders & experts in your field.
    ✅ Engage with high-quality posts (commenting = networking).
    ✅ Post your own insights & projects.
    ✅ Avoid spammy, low-value content.

🧠 What is “Networking”?

At its core, networking just means building genuine relationships with people — especially in your field — so opportunities, info, and support can flow naturally.

It's not fake-smiling and collecting business cards like you're in a movie.

It’s more like:

    “Hey, I’m learning this thing too — mind if I ask you how you solved X?”
    or
    “Saw your project on LinkedIn, it’s dope! I’m working on something similar…”

It’s about being visible, helpful, curious, and open to others.
🔑 Why Networking Actually Matters (Especially for Jobs)

Here’s the truth:

    A LOT of jobs don’t get posted publicly.

    People recommend friends, classmates, or folks they’ve met online.

    HR often prioritizes referrals — it’s less risky.

So if someone knows you, even just a little, and likes your vibe or skills, you’ve already jumped the line ahead of dozens of cold applications.
🎓 What Does “Networking in College” Mean?

Here’s what it might look like:
1. Talking to classmates & seniors

    Help each other with projects, study groups

    Ask seniors how they got internships

    Stay in touch with alumni or students who graduate before you

    “Yo, how did you land that Google internship?” isn’t weird — people love to talk about themselves and help if you’re respectful.

2. Join college clubs or tech communities

    Coding clubs, hackathons, workshops, open mics — real talk, even hanging out at the event counts.

    You’ll meet people working on cool stuff → that’s networking.

3. Go to events / webinars

    If there’s a guest speaker, a tech fest, or online seminar — go.

    Ask questions. DM the speaker after: “Hey, I liked your talk on X. I’m learning Y — got any advice?”

💼 What Does “Networking on LinkedIn” Mean?

This is your public playground to:

    Connect with other devs

    Follow people in companies you admire

    Like or comment on posts (engage, don’t just scroll)

    Share your own progress (e.g., “Just built this project”, “Learning APIs this week”)

And yes — you can DM people. Just don’t be spammy. Here’s a chill example:

    “Hey [name], I saw you’re working at [company] — I’m a student learning full-stack dev. I’d love to hear how you broke into the industry. Totally cool if not, just wanted to say your profile inspired me!”

People reply more than you think — especially if you’re polite and real.
🛠️ How to Actually Start Networking (Simple Steps)

    Make a list of 5–10 people you admire or want to learn from
    Could be LinkedIn folks, seniors, GitHub stars, whatever.

    Engage with them — for real

        Like or comment on a post

        Ask a thoughtful question

        Share something they might enjoy

    Message a few with a casual intro

        Mention something you liked

        Ask a small, specific question

        Thank them even if they don’t reply

    Keep your profile fresh

        On LinkedIn: Add skills, a profile pic, some basic info

        On GitHub: A decent README or public project helps you stand out

☕ Real Talk:

Networking isn’t about being fake or “selling yourself.”
It’s literally just being a human who’s curious and kind.

You’re not too early. You’re not behind. You’re just building your circle.

There's no magic number for “how many people is enough” — but I can break it down based on quality over quantity, and how to avoid overwhelm while still building real connections.
🎓 In College: What's “Enough”?

You don’t need to be friends with the whole campus. Focus on:
✅ 3–5 good people in your major or year

    Code with them

    Do side projects or hackathons together

    Share internship tips or resources

✅ 2–3 seniors or alumni you respect

    Ask how they got internships or jobs

    Stay in touch occasionally (a quick “Hey, congrats on X!” goes a long way)

    🌱 These 5–10 people can make a huge difference — way more valuable than trying to know 100 names casually.

💼 On LinkedIn: What's “Enough”?

You don’t need 1,000 connections. You want intentional connections. Here’s a chill starter range:
✅ 50–200 connections is solid if you’re a student

    Classmates and friends? ✅

    Seniors and alumni? ✅

    People in tech you admire? ✅

    People in companies you’re curious about? ✅

And yes — it’s okay to connect with people you’ve never met in person if your message is respectful and clear (e.g., “I’m a student learning backend dev, love your work at XYZ…”)
🌐 Online in General (GitHub, Discord, Twitter, etc.)

Just ask yourself:

    “Do I have a few people I can ask a question, share something cool with, or just learn from?”

If the answer’s yes, you’re doing great.
⚡ Even just:

    1–2 tech Discords where you’re active

    A few devs you follow on X/Twitter

    GitHub people you admire and occasionally comment on

That’s more than enough to feel part of the dev community.
🧠 TL;DR:
Platform	“Enough” People
College	5–10 solid connections
LinkedIn	50–200 quality connections
GitHub/Online	A few engaged devs or groups
🎤 Final truth:

It’s not about how many people you know — it’s about whether you’re visible, helpful, and curious in the places that matter to you.

Following people on GitHub isn't about popularity—it's about staying connected to meaningful work, learning opportunities, and collaborations. Here's a guide to help you decide *who to follow* and *who to avoid* (or unfollow), even when it involves friends or classmates:

---

### ✅ **Who to Follow on GitHub**

1. **People Who Build or Contribute to Projects You're Interested In**

   * If someone is maintaining a project, tool, or library you use or admire, follow them.
   * Example: Maintainers of React, Python, TensorFlow, etc., if you're into web dev, scripting, or ML.

2. **Peers Whose Work Inspires You**

   * Classmates or friends who share useful, clean, or creative code.
   * People who push updates regularly or explore cool projects.

3. **Developers Who Document and Teach**

   * Some devs write detailed READMEs, good commit messages, and share learning resources.
   * If their repo structure teaches you better coding practices, they're worth following.

4. **Open Source Contributors**

   * Even if they're not "famous", consistent contributors to open source projects often have great workflows and practices you can learn from.

5. **Tech Industry Figures**

   * Engineers from major tech companies who work on public projects or share insights (e.g., on Go, Rust, Linux kernel, etc.).

6. **Project Creators You Rely On**

   * If you depend on their code or libraries for your work, following them helps you stay updated.

---

### ❌ **Who *Not* to Follow on GitHub**

1. **Inactive Users**

   * Friends or classmates who created a GitHub account but never really use it or have one old repo with nothing in it.

2. **Spam or Fork-Only Accounts**

   * If someone only forks repositories without adding value (no commits, no issues, no pull requests), there’s nothing to gain by following them.

3. **Unoriginal/Copy-Paste Coders**

   * If someone just clones tutorials or pushes code from YouTube without credit or understanding, it doesn’t add much to your feed.

4. **“Just Friends” with No Coding Activity**

   * Following for friendship alone can clutter your GitHub activity feed. GitHub is more like LinkedIn for code than Instagram for friends.

5. **Private-Only Users**

   * If a person only works on private repos and doesn’t interact publicly (issues, stars, discussions), following them doesn’t benefit you.

---

### 💡 Pro Tips

* **Use "Star" for Repos, Not Just "Follow" for People:** If someone made a single great repo, star it instead of following the whole person.
* **Check Their Activity Tab:** See how often they contribute, what kind of code they write, and how they engage with others.
* **Curate Over Time:** Unfollow people whose activity becomes irrelevant to you. Your GitHub feed should be a useful resource, not a stream of noise.
