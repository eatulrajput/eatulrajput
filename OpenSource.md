#### A Quick Introduction To Open Source

#### What is open source?

Open-source software(OSS) is a computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. 

Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative, public manner. Open-source software may is a prominent example of open collaboration, meaning any capable user is able to participate online in development, making the number of possible contributors indefinite. The ability to examine the code facilitates public trust in the software.

Open-source code can be used for studying and allows capable end users to adapt software to their personal needs in a similar way user scripts and custom style sheets allow for websites, and eventually publish the modification as a fork for users with similar preferences, and directly submit possible improvements as  pull requests.

#### Why work on Open Source?

There are many benefits to Open Source:
- to organisations and individuals who create projects
- to organisations and individuals who use software
- to individuals who participate in communities

#### Benefits of getting involved as an individual

- You make an impact on code that matters
- You improve your code ability:
    - New Codebases
    - New Pattern
    - New Techniques
- You build relationships

#### (Career!) Benefits of Getting Involved

- Adds more to your portfolio and experience
- Builds your personal reputation
- Contacts and relationships help you find opportunities
- It might even help you ramp up quicker when you join a new company

#### Do it for the right reasons

- If you're only doing open source to get a job, DON'T!
- Open source is not always an easy ticket into the technology industry.
- But it does show your passion to build.

#### But More than Anything Else

- You get to build cool stuff.

#### Do it for the right reasons

- Your primary benefits include:
    - The impact you can have
    - The education and skills you will gain
    - The benefits of joining a community

- And a chance to show your passion for building.

#### It might seem daunting

- Some of the most popular repos can be huge!
    - Hundreds of thousands - or millions - of lines of code
    - Hundreds of issues, incoming changes
    - Not always a lot of documentation
    - Requirements and constraints that might not be clear
    - Large communities of contributors and users

- It takes time to process all of that - and make changes!

## But Valuable Professional Lessons!

- Does this sound familiar?
    - Navigating a huge new codebase
    - Getting familiar with current work
    - Outdated documentation
    - Customers, requirements, constraints
    - New colleagues and teams

- Skills you can practice in an open source project first!

#### Finding a repository

#### Setting Your Sights

- Don't just fish around the biggest, most exciting repository to put on your resume.
- The best open source contributors find repos organically.
- Look for something you think you  will have passion for.

#### Improve something You Use

- There is nothing more organic than finding a repository you yourself use.
- There are two main ways this can happen:
    - You already use it at work
    - You already use it for a side project

- Go to insights tab of a repository, look up the dependency graph
- Improving a repo you use gives  you a massive head start as you will be familiar with calling the APIs as consumer.
- You might already know about some issues you would like to help with, or have some feature ideas.
- This end-user empathy will help you write better code once you're improving the code.

#### Looking at corporate projects

- If you see an opportunity to work on a well known company-led project, that is also great.
- Bear in mind these might come with higer stakes - but also might bring higer rewards!

#### Companies active on GitHub

Look at https://octoverse.github.com

#### Browse the Big GitHub Organisations

Look at https://gitstar-ranking.com/organizations

#### Feeling Lucky?

Look at https://github.com/trending

or Go At Hacker News

#### Don't Limit yourself
- You can learn different things from every project you come into contact with.
- The more familiar you are with a language or a particular ecosystem, the more poductive or active you can be.
- If you can commit the time, the more the better!

#### Getting to a short list

- Let's assume you've identified a list of projects you could contribute to.
- How can you narrow down the list to the couple you should contribute to?

#### Solve A Need

- Join a repo where there is a concrete improvement you can make to it that you will benefit from.
- There are many ways this can happen:
    - You found a bug
    - An API you use can be improved
    - You need a new API in the repo

- Use your self-interest to maintain motivation!

#### Assessing the health of the project

- Heuristics for good candidate open source repositories to contribute to:
    - What was the most recent PR merged in?
    - Do you know someone else who has merged in their code?
    - Is this repo own by a big company?

- Learn to read between the lines.

#### How are the issues aging?


#### Where are the conversations happening?


#### What does the weekly Activity look like?

See the insights of github and check the Pulse.

#### How are the commits trending?


#### If it all checks out

It is time to jump in!

#### Deciding how to participate

#### Time to jump in

- You have identified a repo where  you think you can help!
- You have two big options:
    - Create something new and unplanned in an existing repo
    - Pick up something that's already being identified
- In both cases, try to let the owner or community know!

#### Go With The Flow

- When you're just starting in a repo, you haven't earned anybody's trust.
- So it will probably be hard to propose a change in code alone and get it accepted.
- Best Approach is to try by opening a discussion or an issue first or an issue first - but keep your expectations low.


#### When the stars Align

- But if there is a repo you use
    - with a need you have
    - that already has an open issue on it
    - you are golden!
- Let's start coding and ship it!

#### Parsing Existing Requirements

#### If you're just dipping your toes in
- There are 'code-light ways to get started on an existing project:
    - Help triage issues
    - Work on documentation
    - Website Design
    - Translations
    - Commenting and reviewing other PRs.

- However you contribute, your work will be appreciated and noticed in the GitHub repo.

#### And in the Broader Ecosystem

- Become and advocate for the project:
    - Help promote the project on social media
    - Write article, guides.
    - Present training courses.
    - Etc,

- Help answer questions on Discord, Social Media, Stack Overflow - wherever the community lives
    - But also where it doesn't!  

#### Other Options

- Start your own project? Have you spotted a gap in the market for a project you could build?
    - Breaking through will be much harder/riskier
    - But the rewards and visibility might be greater if you succeed!

- BUT a good hybrid is an extension or plugin to an existing project:
    - Sometimes in subdirectories of the main project
    - Sometimes in separate repos
    - Still good for visibility and your contributory chops

#### How to find the community

- Big repos will often have a discord, slack, or telegram behind them.
- Async communities are Reddit, GitHub Discussions, Twitter/X - and even LinkedIn.
- Find those to really engage with the community and provide(and get!) real-time help

#### Engage with the community

- The key to building relationships and community is to give more than you take.
- Once you get up to speed with the project or the repo, help others!
- The maintainers will notice this and remember you, unlocking other opportunities!

#### Learning the codebase
- This is the one of the most important skills
    - not just in open source
    - but also in your professional future too!

- But there are some smart approaches

#### Understand the basics
- Your goal isn't to read every single line of code and try to understand it that's probably impossible!
- Your goal is too see the forest, not the trees.
- So here are some good questions you should try to answer with the codebase.

##### How are the files structured?
##### What are the operating requirements?
##### Where are the entry points?

#### What are the most important modules? 
- Core classes
- Configuration items
- Hot Functions
- Utilities

#### How does the data flow?

- Is there an overall data design?
- Are there schemas?
- What is the data stored?
- What are the data abstractions?
- Are there RPC or REST or GraphQL conventions?

#### What opinions do the authors have?

- The project may have an explicit style guide(variable naming, tabs style, how braces are used)
- There may be lint and formatting preferences
- unwritten rules you might only discover by reading around the code yourself.
- If there is no style guide, perhaps there should be...?
- Though reformatting a project is a brave move to take!

#### Share what you learn

- But if you find the code tricky to understand then likely others will do.
- Feel free to add comments, write wiki pages, articles about the design you reverse engineered.

#### Learn by doing

- But you can get stuck reading the codebase for days!
- This is unproductive and eventually you will get frustrated.
- Time to jump in and try some new code or debugging?
- After you have gotten the high-level structure of the code, just dive in.
- It's good experience to build good debugging techniques:
    - Find the relevant code behind your first task and just start playing around.
    - Add print statements, add breakpoints, change random lines of code and see what happens.

##### Making Contributions

#### Start with Something small

- Your goal in the beginning is just to get familiar with the workflow, process of buidling, debugging, committing and then putting something up for review.
    - Forking
    - Templated pull request form
    - How to name and document commits

- Think of it as a bootcamp - you are not trying to impress people with crazy heroics - just get yourself comfortable at first.

#### Commit Messages and Conventions

People and few orgs use this convention: look at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/

#### Know the protocols Inside and Out

- Most major repos will have contribution guidelines in the README. Go through it multiple times:
    - On initial join of the repo
    - While writing your changes
    - After you have created an initial draft PR(do a self review before publishing)

- When in doubt, communicate with the maintainers(hopefully they're active in the community you joined from the previous lesson)

#### Follow good practices

- One Diff, One Thesis :Atomic in nature, it should be solving one problem only. Don't try to do same thing at the same time. To make the review easier.
- Good commit and PR titles
- Add context, link to the GitHub issue you're solving
- A thorough test plan, and ideally new tests
- Run any existing linters they have in the repo or read formatting guidelines to apply the practices manually.
- Take the "Level Up Your Code Quality As A Software Engineer" course on Taro!

#### Be Like Water: Bruce Lee

- To repeat: you aren't going to be able to change a whole project's philosophy or style or guidelines or dependencies with one diff.
- So be like water and adapt your own contributions to that of the existing codeabase.
- Don't get into idelogical battles over tabs and spaces!

#### Look at other submissions
- "When in Rome, do as the Romans do"
- "If you want your PRs to be successful, look at other successful PRs that:
    - were merged
    - landed recently
    - Touched the parts of the codebase you are in
    - Is implementing a similar features to yours

- Or one that has lots of discussion - more to learn!

#### Common Pushback

- Does the code address all the edge cases?
- Are there any performance regressions?
- Have you missed an engineering culture behind the code?
- Did you miss important test coverage?
- Did you throw exceptions consitently?
- Have you increased the 'spaghetti'?

#### Isolate The Change with Tests

- Most major projects have tests, smaller ones don't have tests, probably should have or they will have, make sure you can isolate your change with tests.

- Use tests to your advantage.
    - TDD(Test Driven Development) is one option - create the test first.
    - Helps you feel confident in your changes.
    - But it also helps demonstrate how your code works.

- For the maintainers, it can help answer 'so what?'

#### Be Gracious
- If nothing else, remember you are a guest when contributing to someone else's repo.
- Treat feedback as a gift.
- There are many ways to write good software, and the feedback might not match the coding style you're used to.
- This doesn't give you the right to be a stick-in-a-mud, you should adapt to the overall culture of the repo.

#### Help Promote the Change!

- Watch for announcements on the readme and release
- Help with social media, videos, posts and so on
- You don't want to boast but do help promote the repo and the improvement you have made!

### Conclusion

#### First, As Aside

- Most of this course was focused on making contributions to existing repositories which have gained some traction, but what about new repos that you create?
- Growing a new repo is equally a marketing challenge as it is a technical challenge. You need to understand what needs the developer community has, then tell them about solution and why it is different.

#### It Takes Time

- Open Source naturally takes a lot of time. Popular repos are big, and it takes time to earn trust.
- This means that you need to be patient. It will take several months minimum before you're a rockstar contributor on a repo.
- Similar to joining a new team, you will build up momentum over time as you put in the effort.
- Don't get discouraged as you're struggling to understand the codebase, getting small tasks, and getting tons of rejections in code review. It's all a part of the process!
