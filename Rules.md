# Rules for Forking and Contributing to GitHub Repositories

### 1. **Check for a License File**

* **If a repo has a license:**

  * Read and understand it.
  * Follow the license terms strictly.
  * Most open source licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL) allow forking, modification, and contribution with some conditions.

* **If a repo has NO license:**

  * Consider that all rights are reserved by default.
  * You **do not have legal permission** to use, copy, modify, or distribute the code.
  * Forking is technically possible on GitHub, but **you should avoid using or sharing the code publicly** without permission.
  * Do **not contribute code** unless you get explicit permission from the repo owner.

### 2. **When You Want to Contribute**

* Always check if the repo has a CONTRIBUTING.md or clear guidelines.
* If no license or contribution guidelines exist, ask the owner for permission first.
* Respect the project’s code of conduct and contribution rules.
* Make sure your contributions comply with the project’s license.

### 3. **Forking a Repository**

* Fork only repos with an open source license to avoid legal risks.
* If the repo has no license:

  * Fork only for **personal use or study**, not for redistribution.
  * Avoid using the code in your own public or commercial projects without permission.

### 4. **Respect the Author’s Rights**

* Don’t remove or alter existing license files.
* Give proper credit when required by the license.
* Avoid using code in ways that violate the license or copyright laws.

---

### 5. **When in Doubt, Ask**

* Contact the repository owner to clarify usage rights or request adding a license.
* Politely request permission before contributing or using code without a license.

---

### 6. **Use Repositories With Clear Licensing for Your Projects**

* Prefer repos with standard open source licenses.
* This ensures you and others can freely use, modify, and share the code legally.
